## gen-motormaps

The controlled step motor maps require output from 4 runs:
* reverse.lst
* forward.lst
* reverse-stage1.lst
* forward-stage1.lst

The output directories of these runs should be in the ./data directory. 
If you specify the directories on the commandline (see below), there can be
arbitrarily many directories in ./data/. If you want the program to 
automatically find the output directories, put only the four output
directories in ./data .

Then, the motor maps can be generated from the commandline as follows:
> ./gen-motormaps

To set the paths to the output directories manually, add
> ./gen-motormaps fwd_stage1=<dirname> rev_stage1=<dirname> fwd_stage2=<dirname> rev_stage2=<dirname>
where <dirname> is the full path to the output directory.

By default, gen-motormaps will use ./xml_files/usedXMLFile.xml as the base
XML to write into. To change this, use
> ./gen-motormaps xml=<path>

The motor map output (individual motor maps and associated figures) will 
be output to $savedir. The output motor map will also be called $savedir.xml.
By default, savedir will be ./motormaps/mmap_YYYY-MM-DD.
To change this:
> ./gen-motormaps savedir=<dirname>

## goto-s1positions

This scripts integrates the stage 2 motor maps to drive the cobras to ~50 deg.
This is only to drive the stage 2 motors to non-colliding positions, so it is not
strictly necessary to use this to take the stage 1 tests.

> ./goto-s1positions path/to/stage2-fwd-data/Log/

## MATLAB ##

The matlab functions can be called as-is, *if* you are using the system installation
of python. If not, uncomment and modify pyversion to point to the correct installation.

In GotoStage1TestingPositions.m, specdir must be modified to point to
   path/to/stage2-fwd-data/Log/ (as in python wrapper)
